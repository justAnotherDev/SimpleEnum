# SimpleEnum
iOS/Cocoa macro for enum and helper function generation

## What?
Creating enums in Objective C is a pain, especially if you plan to use them for more advanced tasks like iterating through all values or converting them to/from strings.

This macro helps to simplify the process by autogenerating all of the code for you. Now to define an enum all that is needed is:

```objc
SimpleEnumWithValues(CarColorType, CarColorTypeRed, CarColorTypeBlue, CarColorTypeGreen)
```

The preprocessor will transform the above line of code into this:

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, CarColorType) {
  CarColorTypeRed, 
  CarColorTypeBlue, 
  CarColorTypeGreen, 
  CarColorTypeCount
}; 

NSString* StringForCarColorType(CarColorType enumValue);
CarColorType CarColorTypeForString(NSString* enumString);
```

## Why?
To do the code above in a 'proper' way without using a macro is time consuming, error prone and likely to be a pain in the future. This is the code I would have generated by hand.

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, CarColorType) {
  CarColorTypeRed, 
  CarColorTypeBlue, 
  CarColorTypeGreen, 
  CarColorTypeCount
};

NSString* StringForCarColorType(CarColorType enumValue) {
  NSString *colorTypeString = nil;
  switch (enumValue) {
    case CarColorTypeRed: {
      colorTypeString = @"CarColorTypeRed";
      break;
    }
    case CarColorTypeBlue: {
      colorTypeString = @"CarColorTypeBlue";
      break;
    }
    case CarColorTypeGreen: {
      colorTypeString = @"CarColorTypeGreen";
      break;
    }
    case CarColorTypeCount: {
      break;
    }
  }
  return colorTypeString;
}

CarColorType ColorTypeForString(NSString *enumString) {
  CarColorType colorType = 0;
  for (CarColorType i = 0; i < CarColorTypeCount; i++) {
    NSString *colorTypeString = StringForCarColorType(i);
    if ([colorTypeString isEqual:enumString]) {
      colorType = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return colorType; 
}
```

That took a lot of copy and pasting to create! As enum lists grow longer, it becomes quite clear that this is not sustainable, however this is the only way (without using swift!).

## Limitations

• All enums will be 0 based

• Can't map custom strings to enum values
